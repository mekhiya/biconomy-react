```
npm install ethers hardhat @nomiclabs/hardhat-waffle ethereum-waffle chai @nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers
```

3) install hardhat sample project
```
npx hardhat
```

4) hardhat.config.js

5) compile to create contract abi inside artifact folder
```
npx hardhat compile
```

6) start node
```
npx hardhat node
```

7) install env 
```
npm i @symblox/hardhat-dotenv
```
